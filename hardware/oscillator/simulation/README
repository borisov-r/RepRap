Simulation software - LTspice

This is simple oscillator simulation with Timer 555 and NMOS power transistor.
Based on this simulation a schematic and single sided board will be generated.

The board is inteded to be used for initial test of the ABS and PLA extruder.
The board will control manually the extruder temperature or heatbed.
